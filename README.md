# code-flexer README

Retype your code as it should be.

## Features

![feature X](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agistarakha/my-image/main/hello.gif)

- Retype your existing code by just pressing random keys on the keyboard.
- choose retyping speed either to make it more realistic or more godlike.

## Extension Settings

- When activating the FlexMyCode command, you can choose your preferred speed.

## Known Issues

- Remember to stop your typing before the end of the code. There is only a 2-second delay that will save you from your own embarrassment of typing random keyboard keys.
- To execute the "Flex Code" command again, you need to reset the extension state. You can do it by restarting the VS Code window, restarting the VS Code app, or running the "Flex Reload" command.
- This extension was only tested on Windows 10. Other operating systems may have issues that I haven't discovered yet.
